              Senior dignitaries from the Ministry of Defence graced the GAISA
              4.0 event, where the planned integration of this dynamic duo
              “D-JINN.AI” and “Multi-Language Models” by CloudMojo and TCA2I,
              IIT Bombay, respectively, marked a pivotal moment. With defence
              forces comprising members from diverse linguistic backgrounds
              across the country, this innovative approach, proved to have an
              immediate resonance.
              <br />
              <br />
              Arun Vaz, Co-founder of CloudMojo, highlighted “Our integrated
              capability to extract valuable insights from unstructured
              resources and present them in a structured format across multiple
              languages is poised to significantly boost efficiency within
              defence forces and expedite decision-making at all levels. D-JINN
              is gearing up to extend these benefits across diverse domains such
              as healthcare, culture, finance, education and will soon be able
              to process unstructured audio, video, news, and social media feed
              besides text. Organizations interested in this transformative
              solution can register interest through our website d-jinn.ai“.
